## My Interests
- From high school where we started with [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about), Ive always been interested in the art of writing code as it amazes me everyday to the countless solutions that can be created.
- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) is a must, I cant live without watching series.
- I do enjoy going on hikes or camping. Wildlife is sometimes the best escape.
- I have a strong interest in hive and swarm intelligence. I hope to study further on these topics.
